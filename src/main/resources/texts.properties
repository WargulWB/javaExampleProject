#examples
example.log.noArgumentsRequired=This example requires no arguments.
example.builderPattern=Builder Pattern
example.builderPattern.description=The idea behind this implementation is to add an internal Builder-class to a class (likely to be a model class) \
 which can be used to construct a new instance of the class rather than using a class constructor. The benefit of this is, classes which have a \
 large set of parameters would have a large/unreadable constructor, the builder allows the settings per set-Methods which is much easier to read and to use. \
 On top of this the builder can handle any validation of parameters and can provide default value handling.\n\n\
 In this example the %1$s constructs/tries to construct multiple instances of %2$s by using %3$s. Note that the private constructors force the usage of the \
 builder and deny the possibility to use the constructors instead.
example.factoryPattern=Factory Pattern
example.lambdaExpression=Lambda Expression
example.lambdaExpression.description=In this example the usage of functional interfaces and lambda expressions is explained. No arguments are required.
example.listenerPattern=Listener Pattern
example.listenerPattern.description=In this example the listener pattern is displayed. The example class %s implements the %s-interface and is added as listener\
 to %s. This allows the example class to perform its #update(...)-method as reaction of the model changes.
example.streamApi=Stream API
example.streamApi.description=In this example some stream API uses are shown of. \
 The stream API is a new way of chaining multiple operations over collections. \
 Which allows complex collection operations in relative short and easy to read code. \
 For this purpose a private class '%s' is defined inside the example class is defined and used. No arguments are required.
example.stringFormat=Formatted String
example.stringFormat.description=In this example multiple lines of string will be logged which are formatted via String#format(String,Objects...). No arguments are required.
example.optional=Optional
example.optional.description=In this example we will look at the usage of %s to avoid %ss.
example.singletonPattern=Singleton Pattern
example.writeAndReadTextFilesPostJava7=Read And Write Text Files (After Java 7)
example.writeAndReadTextFilesPostJava7.description=This example requires one argument - the path to a file. This file may or may not exist.\
 The example should work anyways. Do note that certain locations, like 'C:' on a windows system, may not be writable.\n\n\
 The example ensures that the files is not written in default system encoding but in UTF-8 encoding.\n\n\
 The program will attempt to write the following text %s %d-times to the given file in overwrite mode (overwriting the content the given file may contain). \
 It will than write the same text %d-times to the file in append mode (appending the given file). Afterwards the program is going to read the written lines back in \
 and log those lines to show, that the writing and reading was successful.
example.writeAndReadTextFilesPreJava7=Read And Write Text Files (Before Java 7)
example.writeAndReadTextFilesPreJava7.description=This example requires one argument - the path to a file. This file may or may not exist.\
 The example should work anyways. Do note that certain locations, like 'C:' on a windows system, may not be writable.\n\n\
 The example ensures that the files is not written in default system encoding but in UTF-8 encoding.\n\n\
 The program will attempt to write the following text %s %d-times to the given file in overwrite mode (overwriting the content the given file may contain). \
 It will than write the same text %d-times to the file in append mode (appending the given file). Afterwards the program is going to read the written lines back in \
 and log those lines to show, that the writing and reading was successful.
